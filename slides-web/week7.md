# Review

Linked lists and arrays work well for _linear_ data structures, but they are not suitable for _hierarchical_ data structures.

## Example <arcticons-animal-kingdom />

Bob's father is Jack, and he has a sister named Alice. How can we represent this information?

<div class="flex justify-center items-center h-240px mt-8px">
    <img src="/week7/animal.webp"  class="h-full" alt="family"/>

# 1. Tree

In computer science, a tree is a widely used ADT that represents a hierarchical tree structure with a set of connected nodes.

<div class="flex">
  <div>
    <img src="/week7/html.png" alt="tree" width="300">
  </div>
  <div>

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Web Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Data Structures</h1>
    <img src="tree.png" alt="tree" />
  </body>
</html>
```

  </div>
</div>

This definition reveals the **parent-children** relationship between nodes in trees.

---

## Definition <arcticons-emoji-evergreen-tree />

A tree can be defined in a **recursive** way: a tree `T` is either _empty_ or consists of a node `r`, called the **root** of `T`, and a (possibly empty) set of _subtrees_ whose roots are the children of `r`.

<div class="flex justify-center items-center h-240px mt-8px">
    <img src="/week7/html.png"  class="h-full" alt="tree"/>
</div>

---

## Terminology <arcticons-todotree />

<div class="flex justify-center items-center h-380px mt-8px">
    <img src="/week7/tree.png"  class="h-full" alt="tree"/>
</div>

---

### Path, Simple Path <arcticons-sente-online-go />

A **path** is a sequence of nodes with the property that each node in the sequence is adjacent to the node linked to it. A path that does not repeat nodes is called a _simple path_.

<div class="flex justify-center items-center h-340px mt-8px">
    <img src="/week7/path.png"  class="h-full" alt="path"/>
</div>

---

### Height <arcticons-treecard />

The **height** of a node is the length of the longest downward path to a leaf from that node. <span class="text-red">The height of an empty tree is -1.</span>

$$height(T) = height(T.root)$$

<div class="flex justify-center items-center h-320px mt-8px">
    <img src="/week7/path.png"  class="h-full" alt="path"/>
</div>

---

# 2. Nodes

Generally, every node has links to its parent and children, and holds a _key_ and an associated _value_ (a.k.a., satellite data).

```python
class Node:
  def __init__(self, parent, children, key, value):
      self._parent = parent
      self._children = children
      self._key = key
      self._value = value
```

For simplicity, we only consider **keys** in this lecture.

<div class="flex justify-center items-center h-200px mt-8px">
    <img src="/week7/bst.png"  class="h-full" alt="node"/>
</div>

---

## Warning <arcticons-foss-warn />

But a tree without constraints has little value in practice. We need to impose some restrictions on the structure of trees.

- **Binary search tree (BST)**
- **Balanced binary search tree**
- **AVL tree**, **Red-black tree**

---

# 3. Binary Trees

> ðŸ“˜ Binary Tree
>
> Each node has exactly two links, which are called its **left** and **right** links, that point to nodes called its _left child_ and _right child_, respectively.

<div class="flex justify-center items-center h-330px mt-8px">
    <img src="/week7/binary.png"  class="h-full" alt="node"/>
</div>

---

# 4. Binary Search Trees

> ðŸ“˜ Binary Search Tree
>
> A binary search tree (BST) is a binary tree where each node has a (_comparable_) key and satisfies the restriction that the key in any node is larger than the keys in all nodes in that node's left subtree and smaller than the keys in all nodes in that node's right subtree.

The <span class="text-red">binary-search-tree property</span>: Let `x` be a node in a BST.

- If `y` is a node in the left subtree of `x`, then `y.key < x.key`.
- If `y` is a node in the right subtree of `x`, then `y.key > x.key`.

<div class="flex justify-center items-center mt-8px">
  <div class="flex items-center">
    <img src="/week7/bst.png" class="h-60 mr-4 object-contain" alt="node"/>
    <p class="max-w-md">
      Thanks to the <strong>binary-search-tree property</strong>, it supports efficient search. For instance, how to search 6?
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

---

## Exercise <arcticons-blackberrydevicesearch />

Is this a valid BST?

<div class="flex justify-center items-center h-240px mt-8px">
    <img src="/week7/invalid.png"  class="h-full" alt="node"/>
</div>

## 4.1 BST: Structure

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, key,
            left=None, right=None):
        self.key = key
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class BST:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = None
```

---

## 4.2 BST: get()

This method is often called `search()`. It is used to get the node containing the given key.

<div class="flex justify-center items-center h-240px mt-8px">
    <img src="/week7/get.png"  class="h-full" alt="node"/>
</div>

The core idea: starting from _root_, trace a simple path downward in the tree until meeting the _key_ or _null_.

---

### Iterative get()

<div class="flex justify-center items-center h-300px mt-8px">
    <img src="/week7/get_alg.png"  class="h-full" alt="node"/>
</div>

- What is time complexity of `get()`?
- How to implement `contains()` based on `get()`?

---

### Recursive get()

- **Base step**: `key` is found or `null` is reached.
- **Recursive step**: search in left or right subtree.

<div class="flex justify-center items-center h-300px mt-8px">
    <img src="/week7/get_alg2.png"  class="h-full" alt="node"/>
</div>

---

## 4.3 BST: put()

This method is often called `insert()`. It is used to insert a new key.

<div class="flex justify-center items-center h-260px mt-8px">
    <img src="/week7/put.png"  class="h-full" alt="node"/>
</div>

The core idea: it works like `get()` by inserting the new key as a leaf node.

---

### Iterative put()

<div class="flex justify-center items-center h-380px mt-8px">
    <img src="/week7/put_alg.png"  class="h-full" alt="node"/>
</div>

`y` is the parent of `x` (`z`).

---

### Exercise

Please draw the BST after inserting 5, 2, 4, 10, 8, 7, 42, in that order into an empty BST.

<v-click>

### Recursive put()

`put(x, key)`: to insert a new key into a BST rooted at `x`, and then return the root.

<div class="flex justify-center items-center h-300px mt-8px">
    <img src="/week7/put_alg2.png"  class="h-full" alt="node"/>
</div>

</v-click>
